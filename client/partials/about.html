				<h5>Solutions Engineer / Software Developer / Industrial Engineer
				</h5>
				<p>I bring 7+ years experience working across a variety of roles in the Tech Sector. These roles have ranged from a proven track record working as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_engineering" target="_blank">Solutions Engineer</a> (my main jam and focus), Operations Analyst, Support Engineer, and as a Web Developer. Most of my domain experience comes from the Human Capital Management (HCM) space and Digital Transformation / Strategy but I have some exposure in  DevOps and Cloud Computing. I studied Industrial Engineering at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (SLO) and learned the fundamentals of full-stack software development at Coding Dojo San Jose (coding bootcamp). Throughout my career, I have focused on solving problems for both rising startups and large enterprise clients through a combination of collaberation and code.

				<h4>2008 - 2013</h4>

			<div class="content2 event_description">
				<p>I attended Cal Poly San Luis Obispo where I graduated with a B.S. in Industrial Engineering - that is the study of processes, optimization, and boosting efficiencies. I joined the Sales Engineering Club and worked in a student call center for ~2 years where I picked up the fundamentals of cold-calling, learned resilience, and developed my business acumen.</p>

			<div class="content2 event_description">
				<p>I began my career as a Solutions Engineer (SE) where I led discovery calls with Account Executives (AEs) with prospects, prepared POCs, and led tailored product demonstrations of HR SaaS solutions to HR Leaders and Executives. This was a pivotal moment in my Sales career by being fortunate enough to be a part in Oracle's first "Class-of" Sales Academy. I began to learn to code HTML/CSS and JavaScript in the evenings which I then applied to making custom POCs for prospects. This boosted the team's revenue and became my "aha" moment as I began to see the potential in learning to code.</p>

				<p>After working for 2 years as a Solutions Engineer, I wanted to try something new - this became my segue into Operations and my plunge into the world of Silicon Valley startups. Joining this Unicorn Startup (as it was at the time) was an opportunity to use my Industrial Engineering degree to improve internal workflows. I did this while supporting a variety of cross-functional teams to ensure customers had an excellent experience. I managed to streamline some of our internal processes by leveraging programming in some of my projects including designing a simple widget that cut onboarding times for new hires by 50%.</p>

				<h2>CODING DOJO SAN JOSE</h2>
				<h4>2016 - 2017</h4>

			<div class="content2 event_description">
				<p>Zenefits had begun to rebrand itself and was rebuilding itself from the ground up. Zenefits gave me a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to experience a hyper-growth environment first hand and I made many lasting connections through the many late nights as a result of that experience. However, I really began to miss Sales Engineering...and my lack of a CS background was a barrier to entry for many of the SE roles in Silicon Valley. I knew I had to learn these skills at some point to be an effective SE so I took this opportunity to go all in to the software developer world.</p>

				<p>The first few lines of code I had written back at Oracle had now evolved into a burning passion of mine. I took that passion and joined a coding bootcamp where students train 1000+ hours learning 3 full technology stacks including Python, Ruby on Rails, and Node. The 'Dojo' was a rigorous experience with many late nights where we "learned to learn" and troubleshoot programming issues with minimal help. In the end, we learned to build full-blown websites and web apps from scratch with both client-side and server-side technologies. </p>

				<p>My first Developer role was with Imajine Studio, a small digital marketing company based in the greater DC Area. I helped the Imajine team gather customer requirements (Wire-frame creation and evaluation), design, test, and deploy live websites for small local business owners. I gained a strong grasp on Content Management Systems (CMS) via using Wordpress and a variety of plugins. </p>

				<p>I joined my 2nd startup as a Global Support Engineer at UpGuard, a company focused on providing Cyber Resilience to SMB and Enterprise IT organizations. In this role, I wrote and tested API scripts to troubleshoot issues encountered by UpGuard's customer base while maintaining a high NPS score and making process improvements within the organization. Despite being a short stint, Upguard was a learning opportunity to learn about IT architecture, Virtual Machines, and the fundamentals of DevOps and Cyber Security concerns.</p>

			<div class="content2 event_description">
				<p>Betterworks became my next startup home where I was finally able to break back into a Solutions Engineering role. After 3 wild years, the bootcamp and all the experiences at the other small companies had paid off. Betterworks enabled organizations to better implement digital strategy and focused execution through a combination of OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) and CFRs (Conversations, Feedback, and Recognition). Betterworks strives to take the processes and methodologies made famous by John Doerr (Google + "Measure What Matters") and give growing startups and enterprises the same recipe to scale and grow just like the other tech giants (ie Google & Intel).</p>

				<p>As a Solutions Engineer, I served as a Subject Matter Expert on the Betterworks platform while serving as a consultant to both internal and external stakeholders. I once again helped AEs qualify prospect accounts through deep discovery while tailoring custom demos and leveraging Challenger Sales to show the value proposition of the Betterworks solution.</p>
